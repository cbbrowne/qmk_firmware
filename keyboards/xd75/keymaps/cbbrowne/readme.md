cbbrowne custom keyboard
==============================

Much of this is copied from my Planck keymap...

1.  Interesting Things
--------------------------------------------------

 * It has some "ANY" keys:
   * RANDDIG generates a random digit (0-9)
   * RANDALP generates a random letter (a-z)
 * It uses enums to number the layers and macros automatically
 * Lighting gets set for various modifiers:
   - QWERTY gets white
   - LOWER gets blue
   - RAISE gets green
   - ADJUST gets orange
   - FUNCTION gets red
 * The layout tries to allow my hands to move both inwards and
   outwards; there are interesting modifiers on columns 0, 6-8, and 14
 * I don't too much care about function keys

2.  TODO
--------------------------------------------------

 * Set up keypad in the middle of the screen?
 * Or perhaps I should set up a layer for that?
 * Definitely want the keyboard to "breathe"
 * Perhaps nice to have some programming constructs as in jeremy-dev
   - It had C operators such as /=, *=, -=, +=, ...
 * Should I have some tmux commands like in mollat?
 * How about adding some emacs commands?
 * Ought to add LED colors for shift and control
